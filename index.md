## About

  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon restrictions, such as social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and the closure of gyms. These public health measures are necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but have had unintentional negative consequences on people’s health. The sudden loss of workout options, change to daily routines, self-isolation, and other factors caused by the pandemic has led to a decline in physical activity. In addition, due to people not being able to socialize and work out together, they may have lost motivation.  COVID-19 has changed the way people interact with each other, and it will exist for the foreseeable future. Moving these once daily social activities to an online platform could bring motivation back to users while maintaining the health of the people. Therefore, we thought it would be a good idea to create a social fitness app to help people stay active during the pandemic.
  
  The objective of our project is to develop an Android-based social fitness application called FitHub. The main goals of this application are to increase people’s fitness engagement and help them connect with others productively while stuck at home. Our application allows users to create challenges, upload a picture as proof of completion, and challenge others to do the same. Users can motivate each other and hold each other accountable. They will also be able to compare with others how many challenges they have completed to inspire friendly competition. This is needed especially during the ongoing pandemic where we are encouraged to stay home.  Our app can be a fun fitness solution to fight against the negative effects of COVID-19.
